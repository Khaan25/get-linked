This is a [GetLinked](https://get-linked-zia.vercel.app/) project created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and TypeScript. I wanted to take a moment to appreciate [David Herbert](https://twitter.com/DaveyHert) and [Get linked](https://twitter.com/getLinkedai) for providing us with this Hackathon. I paid attention to details, and component based which can be used as a template for their website too. I forgot `Modal` after successful registration. I hope I don't lose points cuz of that ðŸ˜Š

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
